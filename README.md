Well ,this was quite a challenging project for me to complete the assignment as an absolute beginner. Yet I tried my level best to fulfill all the requirements of the assignment. So many features needed to include in this project. I tried using firebase and map for the first time in this project. I also tried making the site responsive using bootstrap classes.
So,this is where I ended up finishing the project. Hope you'll consider my hard-work behind the scene. Here goes the link of my project.
